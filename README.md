About the Project
Hi! I'm Dhruv Parshad, a final-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student. I built this project to make dataset cleaning and visualization easier for anyone dealing with raw data.

Whether you're working with a CSV or Excel file, this tool helps you:

Clean the data (handle nulls, fix columns, remove outliers)

Visualize it with graphs (Python) or dashboards (Power BI)

Save the cleaned version for future analysis

💡 What It Does
📥 Load any CSV/Excel file

🧹 Clean data: missing values, formatting, outliers

📊 Create visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn

📈 Build interactive dashboards in Power BI

💾 Save cleaned datasets with just a few clicks

🧰 Tech Stack
Python – pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Power BI – for visual storytelling

Jupyter Notebook – for easy walkthroughs

Excel/CSV – for input/output data

📦 Files Included
project 1.ipynb → Python notebook (cleaning + visualization)

PROJECT 1.pbix → Power BI dashboard/report

✅ How to Use
Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

Follow the code step by step to load and clean your data.

Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop to explore visual dashboards.

Replace the sample data with your own if you like — it's customizable!

🙋‍♂️ About Me
I'm passionate about data, automation, and building tools that actually help.
This project is part of my journey in learning real-world applications of Python, SQL, Power BI, and data analysis.

Let’s connect! 😊
